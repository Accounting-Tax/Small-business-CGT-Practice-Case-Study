 Suggested Solutions

1. Sale of Blackstone Pty Ltd Shares:
   - Division 115: Apply the 50% CGT discount for Barry assuming the gain is not disregarded under Division 152.
   - Division 152: Barry must meet conditions including the MNAV test and active asset requirements. The earn-out arrangement needs to comply with Subdivision 118-I rules.

2. Taxation Implications of the Bonus Arrangement:
   - The bonus arrangement is treated as property under Subdivision 118-I and excluded from initial capital proceeds but included in capital gains calculation when received.

3. Contractual Requirement for Ted:
   - Ted’s post-sale employment does not affect Blackstone Pty Ltd’s ability to apply Division 152-B for concessions related to retirement.

4. Taxation of Restrictive Covenant:
   - General: A restrictive covenant triggers CGT Event D1 creating a capital gain. If paid to Barry he is assessed on the gain; if to Blackstone Pty Ltd the company is assessed. The covenant might be ancillary to goodwill if not separately valued.
